this is a readme file
i originally didnt want to be a cs major. I was looking more into ECE. Eventually I thought since my brother is an ECE major
I could be a computer science major and we could collaborate and do some cool stuff. I hope to learn a lot in Software engineering. 
Thus far during the class I hope I can learn more about the real world situation.
